# Discord-Bots
This is a repository of all of my Discord bots minus my bot tokens. It is all in discord.py, do as you please. There are steps to make a virtual enviroment if you want. REMEMBER replace at the botom 'Token' with your bot token.


### Cloning the Repository
Run the following command to clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mr-0w1/Discord-Bots.git

### Setting up a Virtual Environment
To set up a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
